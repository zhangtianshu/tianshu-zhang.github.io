Hello!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Natural Language Processing group at The Ohio State University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/). Previously, I did my internship at IBM Research (in 2021). Prior to OSU, I received B.S. in CSE from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

My primary research lies in the area of natural language processing and machine learning. Specifically:

- **Natural Language Interface**: building advanced natural language interfaces to tables and relational databases (a.k.a. semantic parsing, table QAs).
- **Learning Paradigm**: instruction tuning and federated learning.
- **Large Language Models**: (pre-)training, evaluation, analysis and data engineering.

*I'm actively looking for collaborators. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in working with me!*
